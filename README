    which pulls user info from the UI
TODO:
    * Still need to implement the Games directory in DB
        -> add individual games
        -> add {username: {top1Score, top2Score, top3Score
                highscore: top1Score}} pairs
    * Implement Highscore values to each game
    * Implement Highscore UI in each game

TODO TO START:
    * Fully implement the Dashboard with view card style per game

IMPROVEMENTS:
    * Add a splash screen between user Sign in/ user Login and the Dashboard class that displays
        a welcome banner with the user's username
